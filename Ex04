In a midLS file, place the command line that will list all files and directories in your

current directory (except for hidden files or any file that starts by a dot - yes, that

includes double-dots), separated by a comma, by order of creation date. Make sure

directoriesâ€™ names are followed by a slash character.

To create a "midLS" file with a command line that lists files and directories in your current directory (excluding hidden files and files starting with a dot), separated by a comma and sorted by creation date, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor.

2. Create a new file and name it "midLS" (without any file extension).

3. Add the following command line to the "midLS" file:

```shell

ls -lt --ignore=".*" --format=comma

```

Let's break down the components of the command:

- `ls`: The `ls` command lists files and directories.

- `-lt`: The `-lt` options sort the list by creation date, with the most recently created files/directories shown first.

- `--ignore=".*"`: The `--ignore=".*"` option excludes hidden files and files starting with a dot from the list.

- `--format=comma`: The `--format=comma` option formats the output, separating each entry with a comma.

4. Save the "midLS" file.

Now, when you run the "midLS" command, it will execute the `ls` command with the specified options and provide a list of files and directories in your current directory (excluding hidden files or files starting with a dot), separated by a comma and sorted by creation date.

Please note that the specific options and syntax of the `ls` command can vary slightly depending on the operating system and shell environment you are using. The above instructions assume a Unix-like environment.
