To create the desired file and directory structure, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the files and directories.

3. Run the following commands to create the necessary files and directories:

```

mkdir test0

touch test1

mkdir test2

touch test3

touch test4

touch test5

ln -s test0 test6

```

4. Set the appropriate permissions for each file and directory using the `chmod` command. Replace "XX" with the desired values for the user and group permissions. The commands are as follows:

```

chmod 750 test0

chmod 754 test1

chmod 450 test2

chmod 420 test3

chmod 514 test4

chmod 420 test5

chmod 755 test6

```

5. Run `ls -l` to verify that the file and directory structure matches the desired output.

Once you have the desired file and directory structure, you can create the tar file "exo2.tar" by running the following command:

```

tar -cf exo2.tar *

```

This command will create a tar file named "exo2.tar" that includes all the files and directories in the current directory.

Please note that you should run these commands on your local machine, as I can only provide instructions and guidance.
