Create a magic file called ft_magic that will be formatted appropriately to detect

files of 42 file type, built with a "42" string at the 42nd byte.

To create a magic file called `ft_magic` that detects files of the "42" file type based on the presence of a "42" string at the 42nd byte, you can follow the steps below:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file named `ft_magic`.
2. Add the following lines to the `ft_magic` file:

```
# Magic file for 42 file type
42       string       42       at=42
```

3. Save the `ft_magic` file.

The `ft_magic` file follows the format used by the `file` command in Unix-like systems to identify file types based on their content. The `42` entry specifies the file type name. The `string` keyword indicates that the detection should be based on a specific string of characters. The `at=42` option specifies that the string "42" should be found at the 42nd byte of the file for it to be recognized as the "42" file type.

You can now use this `ft_magic` file with the `file` command or any other tool that utilizes magic files to identify the "42" file type based on the specified criteria.
