Create a file called z that returns "Z", followed by a new line, whenever the command

cat is used on it.

?>cat z

Z

?>
To create a file called "z" that returns "Z" followed by a new line whenever the `cat` command is used on it, you can use the following commands in a Unix-like operating system:

1. Create a new file called "z" using a text editor or the `echo` command:
```
echo -e "Z\n" > z
```

2. Make the file executable:
```
chmod +x z
```

3. Test the file by using the `cat` command:
```
cat z
```

The output should be:
```
Z
```

By following these steps, you create a file "z" with the desired behavior. Whenever the `cat` command is used on it, it will output "Z" followed by a new line.
