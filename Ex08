 In a file called clean place the command line that will search for all files - in the

current directory as well as in its sub-directories - with a name ending by ~, or a

name that start and end by #

• The command line will show and erase all files found.

• Only one command is allowed: no ’;’ or ’&&’ or other shenanigans.

To create a file called "clean" with a command line that searches for and deletes files with specific names in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor.
2. Create a new file and name it "clean".
3. Add the following command line to the "clean" file:

```shell
find . -type f \( -name '*~' -o -name '#*#' \) -exec rm -f {} \; -print
```

Let's break down the components of the command:

- `find .`: Searches for files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
- `-type f`: Matches only regular files (excluding directories and other file types).
- `\( -name '*~' -o -name '#*#' \)`: Specifies the conditions for file names. It matches files ending with '~' or files starting and ending with '#'.
- `-exec rm -f {} \;`: Executes the `rm -f` command to delete the found files. The `{}` is a placeholder for the file name, and `\;` signifies the end of the `-exec` command.
- `-print`: Prints the name of the deleted files.

Please note that this command will permanently delete the files it finds, so exercise caution when using it. It's always a good idea to make a backup of your files before running such commands.

Save the "clean" file and make sure it is executable by running the following command:

```shell
chmod +x clean
```

Now, you can run the "clean" script by executing the following command:

```shell
./clean
```

This will search for files with names ending in '~' or starting and ending with '#', delete them, and display the names of the deleted files.

Please be cautious when using the script and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to delete the files in the specified directories.
