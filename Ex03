Chapter VI
Exercise 03: SSH me!
Exercise 03
SSH Key
Turn-in directory : ex03/
Files to turn in : id_rsa_pub
Allowed functions : None
• Create your own SSH key. Once it is done:
◦ Add your public key to your repository, in a file name id_rsa_pub
◦ Update your ssh key on the intranet. This will allow you to push the repository
to our git server.
To complete Exercise 03 and create your own SSH key, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
2. Use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate a new SSH key pair. This command creates a public key (`id_rsa.pub`) and a private key (`id_rsa`) in the specified directory. By default, the keys are stored in the `~/.ssh/` directory.

   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your actual email address. You can also specify a different directory to store the keys if desired.

3. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase. It's recommended to set a passphrase for added security, but you can leave it blank if you prefer.
   ```
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   Enter same passphrase again:
   ```

4. Once the key pair is generated, you can find the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) in the specified directory (e.g., `~/.ssh/`).

5. Add the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to your repository. Create a file named `id_rsa_pub` in the `ex03/` directory of your repository and paste the contents of your public key into it.

6. Update your SSH key on the intranet. Access the intranet or any relevant platform where you can manage your SSH keys. Locate the option to add or update your SSH key and paste the contents of your public key (`id_rsa.pub`) into the designated field.

7. Save the changes, and now you should be able to push your repository to the git server using SSH.

Remember to keep your private key (`id_rsa`) secure and do not share it with anyone.
