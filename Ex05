tory.

To test your script, we will use our own environment.Certainly! Here's a shell script named "git_commit.sh" that displays the IDs of the last 5 commits in a Git repository:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

git log --pretty=format:%H -n 5
```

Let's break down the script:

- The shebang `#!/bin/bash` ensures that the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.
- `git log` is the command that retrieves the commit history.
- `--pretty=format:%H` specifies the output format to only display the commit IDs (hashes).
- `-n 5` limits the output to the last 5 commits.

To test the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor.
2. Create a new file and name it "git_commit.sh".
3. Copy the script above into the "git_commit.sh" file.
4. Save the file.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt.
6. Navigate to the directory containing the "git_commit.sh" file.
7. Run the following command:

```shell
bash git_commit.sh | cat -e
```

The `bash git_commit.sh` command executes the script and pipes the output to `cat -e`, which displays the output with a dollar sign ($) at the end of each line.

Please note that you should run the script in your own environment with your own Git repository to get the correct output.
