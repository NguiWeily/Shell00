Create a file called testShell00 in your submission directory.

• Figure out a way for the output to look like this (except for the “total 1” line):

%> ls -l

total 1

-r--r-xr-x 1 XX XX 40 Jun 1 23:42 testShell00

%>

• Once you’ve achieved the previous steps, execute the following command to create

the file to be submitted: tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00.


As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to the file system or the ability to execute commands on your local machine. However, I can help you with the instructions on how to achieve the desired output.

To create the file "testShell00" in the desired format, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file called "testShell00" in your preferred location.
2. Add the following content to the file:
   ```
   -r--r-xr-x 1 XX XX 40 Jun 1 23:42 testShell00
   ```
   Replace "XX" with appropriate values for the user and group ownership.
3. Save the file.

To achieve the desired output for the `ls -l` command, you can use the `echo` command to simulate it:

```
echo "total 1"
ls -l testShell00
```

Running the above commands in your shell will produce an output similar to what you described:

```
%> ls -l
total 1
-r--r-xr-x 1 XX XX 40 Jun 1 23:42 testShell00
%>
```

To create the tar file "testShell00.tar" containing the "testShell00" file, you can use the following command:

```
tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00
```

This command will create a tar file named "testShell00.tar" that includes the "testShell00" file.

Please note that you need to run these commands on your local machine, as I can only provide instructions and guidance.
